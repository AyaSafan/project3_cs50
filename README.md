Menu: The web application supports all of the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge).

Adding Items: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) are able to add, update, and remove items on the menu.

Registration, Login, Logout: Site users (customers) are be able to register with a username, password, first name, last name, address, phone, and email address. Customers are then be able to log in and log out of the website.

Shopping Cart: Once logged in, users are able to see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping is saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.

Placing an Order: Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they should be able to place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total (no need to worry about tax!) before placing an order.

Viewing Orders: Site administrators have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed. Site administrators can change order status to done.

Personal Touch: Allowing site administrators to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders. Users recieve a confirmation email once their order is placed and once it is done.
